The EFD files are for Expression Frequency Distribution. They are for building the histogram plots for the distribution 
of gene expression in each different cancer cohorts.

The ethan_getExpressionJSONarray.js is a JavaScript file containing the function: ethan_getExpressionJSONarray. This function
is useful for inputing a list of cancer cohorts and a list of gene cohorts to get back an array of JSONs where each JSON
contains the cohort, the gene, and RNA Sequencing data pulled from the GDC for that cohort & gene.
