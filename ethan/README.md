The index files are for building the expression frequency distribution histogram and heat map visuals of gene expression in different cancer cohorts.

The ethan_getExpressionJSONarray.js is a JavaScript file containing the function: ethan_getExpressionJSONarray. This function
is useful for inputing a list of cancer cohorts and a list of genes to get back an array of JSONs where each JSON
contains the cohort, the gene, and RNA Sequencing data pulled from the GDC for that cohort & gene.
